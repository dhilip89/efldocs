# Textblock

## Introduction
This document serves as a complement to the existing [Textblock Documentation and Tutorial](http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/efl/group__Evas__Object__Textblock.html#Evas_Object_Textblock_Tutorial "") in the official EFL documents.

The Textblock object is an extensive tool for handling complex texts, such as ones that have multiple styles and multilined. More complex features offer text alignement, wrapping and item embedding e.g. icons.
Currently, this is the favorable way of handling text in EFL, and demand for more a comprehensive explanation had led to the forming of this document.

## The Textblock Object
EFL's Evas Textblock object offers many features, which are highly popular in most text applications nowadays. Currently, it supports the following:
- Multilines
- Wrapping (word/char/mixed) and ellipsis
- Alignment (auto/manual)
- Styles
- Formatting
- Item embedding (e.g. icons)
- Bidirectional text (BiDi)

Moreover, the Evas Textblock object has been extended to [Edje Entry](http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/edje/group__Edje__Text__Entry.html) and [Elementary Entry](http://docs.enlightenment.org/auto/elementary/group__Entry.html) to offer even more features.
Bidirectional text is under development and is aimed to comply with current Unicode standards.
