This is just a file to put the info in, it's not really wiki material.

An index to the diagrams:
Textblock is the textblock itself.
Solid lines are pointers that are "needed", that is, are actively used and must be there in the "data" conceptually.
Dotted lines are list connections, which means they are only needed because of the iteration, but not really useful for the concept.
Dashed lines are connections that are useful for optimizations and generally good to have, but not essential. 


Comments:
(1) This can only happen when legacy newline is off. Otherwise, a line break would cause a paragraph break.
